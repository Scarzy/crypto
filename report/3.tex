The approach taken to determine this was to observe that the capitalisations of characters, along with the length of words, looked approximately correct for standard English.
This meant that it was likely to be some form of substitution cipher.
The attempt to crack it was made initially by attempting to replace a couple of likely looking letters; there were a large number of upper case `R's as single character words, meaning it was likely to be an `I', `z' was used as a single character word in a number of places and as the first letter in a number of double letter words, so was likely to be an `a'.
Then some basic frequency analysis was done, and `v' occurred many more times than any other character, which suggested it might be an `e'.

At this point further analysis was about to be undertaken, when it was observed that the `z'-`a', and `v'-`e' substitutions suggested that the alphabet had just been reversed.
A reversed alphabet was then used to decrypt the message, and proved successful.

For clarity, the substitutions used are shown below:
